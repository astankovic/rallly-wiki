This section covers **Advanced Features and Integrations**, designed for power users, team administrators, and self-hosters who want to extend functionality beyond core poll creation and voting. These tools enable seamless connections to external services, custom branding, enhanced security, and global accessibility. They build on basic account management in [User Settings and Preferences](user-settings-and-preferences.md) and self-hosting setups in [Self-Hosting and Administration](self-hosting-and-administration.md). For team-based usage, combine with features in [Spaces and Team Collaboration](spaces-and-team-collaboration.md).

## Overview

Advanced features provide deeper customization and connectivity, including syncing polls with calendars for reminders, generating API keys for third-party apps, moderating content in shared spaces, applying white-label branding, and supporting multiple languages. Access these via the **Account Settings** menu under **Advanced** tab or the **Space Settings** panel for team-specific options. Main capabilities include one-click integrations, toggleable moderation rules, and instant preview for branding changes.
