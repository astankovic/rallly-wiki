This section introduces **Rallly**, a web application for creating scheduling polls that help groups find the best time for meetings or events based on everyone's availability. It's ideal for individuals coordinating with friends or colleagues, teams using shared **Spaces** for collaboration, and organizations needing centralized management, with support for guest participation (no account required), personal accounts, and self-hosted deployments. Rallly eliminates back-and-forth emails by letting poll creators propose time slots and participants vote quickly. For hands-on setup, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md). Learn about team workflows in [Spaces and Team Collaboration](spaces-and-team-collaboration.md), poll creation in [Creating and Sharing Polls](creating-and-sharing-polls.md), and advanced options like [Self-Hosting and Administration](self-hosting-and-administration.md).

## What is Rallly?

**Rallly** lets you create a poll with proposed dates and times, share a link with participants, and view results to pick the optimal slot. Participants simply click their available options—no login needed for guests. Logged-in users can manage multiple polls, customize settings, and access advanced features.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Rallly** is pronounced like "rally" (as in gathering people) but with an extra *L*.

Key capabilities include:
- Proposing multiple time slots in a single poll.
- Real-time voting and result visualization (e.g., heatmaps showing availability).
- Customizable poll titles, descriptions, and lengths.
- Support for unlimited polls and participants on the free plan.
- Team **Spaces** for shared polls, member invites, and group billing.

## User Roles and Access Levels

Different roles determine what you can do in **Rallly**. Guests have basic voting access, while account holders unlock management tools.
