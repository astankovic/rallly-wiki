This section covers **User Settings and Preferences**, the central place for personalizing your account information, securing your access, and adjusting how the app looks and behaves. It's designed for all users—from individuals creating personal polls to team members in shared **Spaces**—to make the platform feel tailored to their needs. Changes here affect your experience across polls, voting, collaboration, and notifications throughout the app. For account basics, see [Account Creation and Login](account-creation-and-login.md). For notification specifics, see [Notifications and Emails](notifications-and-emails.md). Related team settings appear in [Managing Members](managing-members.md) and [Space Dashboard](space-dashboard.md).

## Overview

**User Settings and Preferences** provides tabs or sections for managing your profile details, updating security credentials, selecting display preferences like language and theme, and controlling notifications. Access it via your profile icon in the top-right corner, then select **Settings** from the dropdown menu. All changes save automatically after confirmation, with previews where applicable (e.g., theme switches).
